# Danbooru Prompt
Extension that gets tags for Danbooru images links in AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion webui

# Credit:
A lot of code I used for this project came from this project:
https://github.com/antis0007/sd-webui-gelbooru-prompt


@Malisius  repo's showed me a better way to scrape the tags.

## What is this?
This is a small extension I wrote to let you automatically pull the tags for any saved Danbooru image link in [AUTOMATIC1111's stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

## Additional Info:

### How does this work?

Example:
All you need to do is hit the "Get Tags" button, and it will put the fetched tags into the text prompt textbox.
You can specify wether to include the artist or the characters tags.

The tags will be shown here, img2img is also supported:

You can now use these tags in any prompt crafting you'd like to do. Enjoy!
